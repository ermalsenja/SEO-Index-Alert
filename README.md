SEO Index Alert is a lightweight tool inspired by the work of Nerd-Rush on GitHub https://gist.github.com/Nerd-Rush/cdb8e611478d9b554afc845fe23784af It visually warns administrators when the 'Discourage search engines from indexing this site' option is enabled. The plugin enhances usability by modifying the admin bar's appearance and displaying a dismissible admin notice, ensuring your site's SEO visibility settings are always in check.
